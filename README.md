# Hospital Inpatient Discharges Analysis – Uncovering Length of Stay, Cost Drivers, and Emergency Care Impact

This Power BI dashboard project explores patterns in inpatient hospital discharges using publicly available healthcare data. The goal is to help healthcare professionals, analysts, and decision-makers better understand what drives hospital stay durations, treatment costs, and the impact of emergency admissions.

The project is built entirely in Power BI Desktop, with a structured four-page interactive report designed for executive-level insights and operational deep dives.
